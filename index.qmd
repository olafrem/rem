Hi! My name is Olaf Remiszewski and I am a first semester graduate student at the [European University Viadrina](https://www.europa-uni.de/en/index.html) in Frankfurt (Oder). I am currently pursuing my master's degree in international business administration with focus on finance and international economics. Since this semester I embarked on a new journey and delved into the world of data science and programming.


I obtained my B.Sc. at the [European University Viadrina](https://www.europa-uni.de/en/index.html). In my bachelor thesis I elaborated on potential drivers of the seasonality effect in the cross-section of returns, which can be found primarily in the U.S. stock market. Besides that, I briefly investigated two other phenomena related to the predictive power of past returns, namely short-term momentum and long-term reversal.

During my bachelor studies I had the privilege to spend a semester abroad at the [University of Southern Denmark](https://www.sdu.dk/en) in Odense and to do an 6-months internship in corporate banking at one of the leading financial institutions in Europe: [UniCredit](https://www.unicreditgroup.eu/en.html).

As the course ["Becoming Fluent in Data and Beyond"](https://becoming-fluent-in-data.com/) is slowly drawing to a close, I would like to express my gratitude for the opportunity to delve into the world of data and to get in grips with the programming language R, as I am looking forward for other programming courses and the challenges ahead. Firstly however, I want to deliver a superb final project!
